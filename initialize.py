	{'title': '6 Ways to Share Your Fitness Progress Without Looking Like a Tool', 'photo': 'right1.jpg', 'description' : "Progressing on your fitness journey is an exciting time. So much hard work, literal sweat, and maybe tear, and you're finally seeing success! Of course you want to share your achievements with others. But on the same time, sharing your progress could make you seem vain. This can be a tricky situation to navigate, so try sticking to these guidelines. Don't Be a Know It All You've made some breakthroughs, but that doesn't necessarily make you an expert on health. Plus, giving unsolicited advice to others can make you seem patronizing. And while your results might make you more qualified to give advice than any regular old couch potato, you should be cautious advising anyone unless you have a degree in fitness or nutrition. What works for you might not work for another person, and worse, providing bad advice can get that person injured. Be Modest There's a fine line between being proud about your accomplishments and being show offy about them. Consider your language when talking or posting about your progress. Try not to frame it as, fCheck out how awesome my abs look! Some people might see this as unbridled enthusiasm, but most others will just see this as bragging. Instead, focus on the work you've put in, the progress you've made, and the journey you still have to make. Dont Overshare We all have that friend. You know, the one who posts almost every day with a map of the route they ran that afternoon. Don't be that friend. If you feel compelled to share your fitness progress which you have every right to just don't do it every day. You want to surprise people with the improvements you've made, and you can't do that when you're updating folks on the miniscule details of your gym going experience. Skip the daily gym check ins and selfies. Instead, make sharing an every once in a while thing. Don't Make It the Only Thing You Talk About Your fitness progress can be the biggest thing in your world, but that doesn't mean it's important to everyone else. Think about all the baby photos you see on Facebook and all the lame stories your coworkers tell you about their weekends. Those can be the most important things going on in their lives, but that doesn't mean you have to care. You should realize that your friends and family might also get sick of hearing about your fitness progress.Remember Your Audience While not everyone will care about the progress you've made, some are more likely to have an interest. If you've made friends at the gym or you're in a Crossfit group with some wonderful people, you know you all have fitness in common. They're likely want to hear more about your fitness than, say, your coworkers. If you feel the urge to share, consider opening up a group chat or private group with like minded people.Keep It to the Fitness Social Networks Better yet, keep your fitness progress updates contained to the places they're most appropriate: fitness centered social networks. It's a big world of social media out there, and Facebook and Instagram are no longer the best places to post about your fitness. There are much better networks, such as MyFitnessPal and Fitbit, that were built specifically for sharing your fitness progress."},
	{'title': '5 Beauty Tips That Will Make Your Face Look Younger', 'photo': 'left2.png', 'description' : "1. Use SPF Daily :  Using sun protection factor (SPF) daily is a must to prevent premature signs of aging due to sun damage. Choose beauty products, such as facial moisturizers, that already contain SPF to help simplify your beauty regimen. The American Academy of Dermatology suggests using broad spectrum protection, meaning protection from both UVA and UVB sun rays, with SPF of 30 or above. Look for skincare products that meet this requirement, such as Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair moisturizer with broad spectrum SPF 30 sunscreen. 2. Moisturize with Retinol Based Products :  Retinol, a form of vitamin A, reduces early signs of aging like wrinkles and loss of skin elasticity, according to a 2012 review published in Dermato Endocrinology. Authors of this review suggest using retinol containing skin products in combination with sunscreen for wrinkle prevention. 3. Exfoliate Chemically :  Exfoliating your face chemically refreshes and smoothes your skin, reduces fine lines and wrinkles, and helps get rid of skin discoloration, according to the American Academy of Dermatology. Chemical exfoliation may sting slightly, works best on fair skin, and is not recommended for pregnant and nursing women, according to the American Society for Dermatologic Surgery. Ask your dermatologist if you are a good candidate for chemical peels. 4. Get Proper Nutrients :  Your diet does indeed affect your skin, and getting the right nutrients helps prevent premature signs of aging. The 2012 review published in Dermato Endocrinology reports that nutritional supplements, especially antioxidants, help delay skin aging. Authors of the review suggest vitamin C, vitamin E, carotenoids, copper, and selenium when you want younger looking skin. 5. Maintain a Healthy Weight   and Exercise :  Being overweight can add years to your appearance, so stay at a healthy weight to maintain a youthful look. Regular exercise is an excellent way to reach your weight management goal, and provides you with additional anti aging benefits. A 2015 study published in Aging Cell found that endurance exercise, such as jogging, swimming, biking, or using an elliptical machine, slows age associated changes that occur in skin."},

	{'title': "4 Easy Workouts to Do When You're Pregnant", 'photo': 'left3.jpg', 'description' : "Did you just find out you're pregnant? If so, chances are you are feeling pretty ecstatic about the news. But you may also be wondering what this means for your workout program. How will you continue? It's clear your normal gym sessions need to change. But how? Here are a few great workouts that you can start doing now that you're pregnant. Uphill Walking :  As your pregnancy progresses along, you may not be able to keep up with the jogging or running you used to. While some women do still perform these workouts, for most, it leaves them feeling quite awkward and uncomfortable. Uphill walking fills in nicely. It's a bit more intense than flat walking, but not so intense that it's unsafe for you during this pregnancy period. Add the incline, turn on your favorite music, and get going. Pregnancy Yoga Pregnancy oriented yoga classes are one of the best ways to stay in shape during your pregnancy period. The great thing about yoga is that there are so many different poses that you can try, all of which will hit your body differently. Be sure when joining a yoga class that you are doing one specifically tailored to the pregnant woman's needs. Certain yoga poses could be downright dangerous for you and your developing baby during this time, so you do want to choose carefully. A good pregnancy based instructor should know this. Machine Free Weight Training If there were ever a time to train with machine weights over free weights, now would be it. While you don't need to switch your entire workout away from free weights, as your balance will be off now with your tummy developing, having that extra support from the machine can be very helpful. For instance, the leg press is a smart move than doing full on barbell squats and likewise, the chest press will be a better option than a classic bench press as lying flat on your back as you progress through your pregnancy is also not advised. Swimming Finally, don't overlook swimming. Far too many women completely forget about this workout but it's a great one for use during pregnancy. As you won't have any impact on your joints when swimming, this can give those swollen legs and ankles a rest. Plus, it's a great way to add more resistance to your workouts without using actual weights. And even better, you'll work both the upper and lower body at the same time, so it's an excellent complete workout session. So keep these few workouts in mind as you prepare for the next nine months ahead. If you train smartly during this period, you can stay fit and best of all, it'll all help you bounce back faster to your pre pregnancy weight once again."},
	{'title': 'Keep Your Blood Pumping With 7 of the Best Exercises for Healthy Circulation', 'photo': 'right3.jpg', 'description' : "Having healthy circulation is so important! Your blood carries oxygen and nutrients to every part of your body. Without proper blood flow, your body is deprived of both oxygen and the nutrients it needs to function properly. By boosting your circulation, you can improve your overall body function and reduce your risk of heart disease, obesity, and diabetes. Here are some of the best exercises for healthy circulation: Burpees   These bad boys are brilliant for not just circulation, but your fitness overall! The movement (squat, jump to plank position, push up, jump your feet to hands, stand, jump into the air, and repeat) hits your chest, triceps, shoulders, core, quads, hamstrings, and glutes, depleting oxygen from these major upper and lower body muscle groups. This forces your heart and lungs to work harder to supply oxygen, giving you an excellent cardio workout that will improve circulation! Warrior Poses   Yoga's Warrior poses (Warrior I, Warrior II, and Warrior III) are all excellent for your circulation. Not only do they engage your muscles (legs, back, and shoulders), but they help you to expand your lung capacity and focus on your breathing. Jump Squats   Jump squats combine explosive strength training with regular muscle building. The Squat portion of the exercise hits your leg muscles (quads, glutes, and hamstrings), but your cardiovascular system has to work extra hard to do the Jump part of the exercise. A few sets of Jump Squats every day will do wonders for your circulation! Kettlebell Swings   This movement enhances mobility, increases muscular strength, and engages most of the major muscle groups in both your upper and lower body. The more muscles are engaged, the more your body has to work to deliver oxygen and nutrients to the tired muscles. Kettlebell Swings are great for your cardiovascular conditioning, and will help to enhance your circulation significantly. Lunges   Lunges engage all of the muscles in your lower body (quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, and calves). Your lower body muscles are the largest muscle group, meaning they use more energy and oxygen than your chest or back. The more you work the muscles, the more your heart and lungs have to work to deliver oxygen and nutrients. This leads to an excellent boost in your circulation!  Jump Rope   Jump rope is, by far, one of the best forms of cardiovascular conditioning. There is a bit of impact on your joints (particularly the feet joints), but it's easier on your knees and back than running. Jumping is also harder on your body than running, meaning your heart and lungs have to work harder to pump blood and oxygen through your body. The result: better circulation! You should include jump rope in every workout. Jogging/Running   There's nothing like good old fashioned running or jogging to get your heart pumping, your lungs working, and your blood flowing. Try some HIIT training for a serious cardiovascular workout, or do a slow jog for 45 minutes to enhance your endurance. No matter how you run, in the end, you'll improve your circulation. These exercises are the BEST to enhance circulation and blood flow, promoting a healthy heart and reducing your risk of cardiac disorders."},
